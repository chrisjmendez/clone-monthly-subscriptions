# Installing Ruby on Rails 4.x

## Pre-Setup

If you're on Mac OS X, you'll need to do a few things before you can get Ruby on Rails set-up. 

### Step 1 - xCode command line tools

Open up Terminal and type:
```language-bash
 xcode-select --install
```

Double Check your work
```
xcode-select -p
```



### Step 2 - Install Homebrew package manager

Installing [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) is pretty self explanatory. 





### Step 3 - Use Homebrew to install GNU Privacy Guard

gpg, an encryption program used to check the security of the RVM download. 

```
brew install gpg
```
